# C---Page-Replacement
This is a page replacement simulator written in C

This is an exercise I was handled in my University course "Operating Systems I". The task is :

Develop a Page Replacement simulator based on First in First Out(FIFO) and Least Recently Used(LRU) replacement algorithms for a parametric
number of memory frames. The input will be given through a text file indicating the page ID requested , along with command line arguments 
indicating the files names and which algorithm should be ran . For each page requested the programshould print on a seperate text file if 
it was a HIT or a  Page Fault(PF) as well as the Page Fault Rate. Aditionnaly , for input3.txt , a statistics board with your results for 
10 and 100 memory frames for both given algorithms. The project shall include one source file named page_replacement.c along with a 
readme.txt including your implementation details and the statistics board.
